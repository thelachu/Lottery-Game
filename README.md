LOTTERY GAME

This is a web-based interactive Lottery Game where users can randomly win gifts by clicking the "Roll Lottery" button. The game dynamically generates 50 gift items using JavaScript and applies CSS animations for a smooth flashing effect during the lottery draw. A coin sound effect enhances the experience, making it more engaging. The whole game is fully responsive and works across desktop and mobile browsers.

It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with dynamic DOM manipulation and audio playback to create an interactive experience.
